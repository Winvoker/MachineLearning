# MachineLearning

Hello , I am Batuhan. In this repository you can find codes that i wrote when i was learning machine learning.


## Python

This folder consist of Machine Learning Algorithms in Python. In this codes I used **pandas** for manupulating data frames.
In addition, I used **matplotlib** for plotting my datas , and **sckitlearn** for machine learning algorithms.Also , I
wrote this codes when i was taking **DATAI TEAM's Machine Learning and Deep Learning Courses** on Udemy.

# MachineLearning

Hello , I am Batuhan. In this repository you can find my machine learning codes and projects.


## Octave-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This folder consists implementation of Machine Learning Equations to Octave. Also these codes are my assigments for
**MIT-Machine Learning Course** on Coursera.

* Mathematical Implementation of Linear Regression
  * Cost Function J
  * Graident Decent

## Python

This folder consist of Machine Learning Algorithms in Python. In this codes I used **pandas** for manupulating data frames.
In addition, I used **matplotlib** for plotting my datas , and **sckitlearn** for machine learning algorithms.Also , I 
wrote this codes when i was taking **DATAI TEAM's Course** *Machine Learning ve Python A'dan Z'ye Makine Öğrenmesi* on Udemy.

* Regression Model
  * Linear Regression 
  * Multiple Linear Regression
  * Polynomial Linear Regression
 * Decision Tree

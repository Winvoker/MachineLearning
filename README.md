# MachineLearning

Hello , I am Batuhan. In this repository you can find my machine learning codes and projects.


## Python

This folder consist of Machine Learning Algorithms in Python. In this codes I used **pandas** for manupulating data frames.
In addition, I used **matplotlib** for plotting my datas , and **sckitlearn** for machine learning algorithms.Also , I 
wrote this codes when i was taking **DATAI TEAM's Machine Learning and Deep Learning Courses** on Udemy.

* Regression Model
  * Linear Regression 
  * Multiple Linear Regression
  * Polynomial Linear Regression
 * Decision Tree
 * Random Forest Regression
 * Logistic Regression
 * KNN Classification
 * Support Vector Machine
 * Artifical Neural Network with PyTorch
 * Artificial Neural Network with Keras
 * Recurrent Neural Network with Keras

## Octave-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This folder consists of implementation of Machine Learning Equations to Octave and Matlab. Also these codes are my assigments for
**MIT-Machine Learning Course** on Coursera.

* Mathematical Implementation of Linear Regression
* Mathematical Implementation of Logistic Regression(Classification)
